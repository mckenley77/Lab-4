# Lab-4
This project allows the user to enter a Pokemon type then shows the users Pokemon cards of that type that can be used to make a deck.

## Issues
* Problem - Getting no cards found when entering the type. Fix - Ensured I was making the proper API call when searching for cards of a certain type.
* Problem - The ID of the card wasn't showing so I had no idea exactly what API call was being made. Fix - Ensured I included the Pokemon card ID when making an API call.
